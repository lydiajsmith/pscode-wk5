d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
 
list = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 
Average = sum(list)/len(list)

Minimum = min(list)
Maximum = max(list)

Print "The average of this list is [average]."
Print "The minimum of this list is [minimum]."
Print "The maximum of this list is [maximum]."
