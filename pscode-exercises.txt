c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
 
list = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 
average = sum(list)/len(list)

minimum = min(list)
maximum = max(list)

print(f"The average of this list is {average}.")
print(f"The minimum of this list is {minimum}.")
print(f"The maximum of this list is {maximum}.")
